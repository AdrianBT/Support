    <h1>Breast cancer awereness mounth!</h1>
    <h4>Breast Cancer Awareness month is not to tell people that breast cancer exists, but to instead encourage people to get screened 
        (many clinics offer free breast cancer screenings for the month) or check themselves.

        Breast cancer can be very treatable if caught early, and you can catch it early by just checking yourself. Most people don't do regular checks,
         so Breast Cancer Awareness month exists to remind and educate people. </h4>
